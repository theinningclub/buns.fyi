## What is it?

Twice a year, naked students deliver sugary donut delights to the studious denizens of Brown University's libraries. This machination of mischief and merriment dates as early as 1998, and was [recently featured in the Brown Daily Herald](https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2022/10/its-so-brown-nudity-controversy-body-positivity-on-campus). It's a triumphant celebration of the semester's end, yummy treats, and body positivity.

## When is it?

The run takes place in an evening sometime during reading period — the mystery of the exact time and date is part of the surprise!

While we welcome spectators, please respect our runners and NEVER record, photograph, or post pictures of the event.

## Where is it?

We deliver donut delights to:

* John D Rockefeller Library
  * Floors 1–4
* Sciences Library
  * Basement
  * Mezzanine
  * Floor 3
  * Floors 7–13

## Where isn't it?

We at the NDR understand that not everyone is comfortable seeing a naked body. We respect that, so every year we declare certain areas of the libraries as no-go zones for our runners.

The following locations will be sign-posted no nudity (and no donut) zones:

* John D Rockefeller Library
  * Absolute Quiet Room (Level A)
*   Sciences Library
  * Floor 4
  * Floor 5
  * Floor 6

If you're on these floors, you won't see a runner, and you can continue to work in peace!

Additionally, people studying in the libraries will be notified just before the Naked Donut Run occurs so that those who don't want to be present will have plenty of time to move to a No-Donut Zone or leave the library.

## How do I participate?

The Naked Donut Run is open to any Brown and RISD students! We have runners of all shapes and sizes, and we strive to reflect the wide diversity of students on College Hill.

If you would like to participate, [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvwdP06f6pKqKi8lg-cnzKClYRGhO4z-M7d6briNFxAiXz2Q/viewform) and we'll be in touch.

## I have more questions!

### What are the vibes like?
High-energy and low-pressure!

### Can I run with friends?
Absolutely! The more the merrier! We do not divide runners into teams, or otherwise separate participants from their friends in any way.

### Who organizes the NDR?
The NDR is organized each year by volunteers who have participated in previous years! 

### I have even more questions!
